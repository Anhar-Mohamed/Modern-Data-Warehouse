Data Source: Started with cleaning up a great dataset from Kaggle.
The Engine Room: Used Python for complex transformations, then relied on Talend: to make sure our data flow was smooth and reliable (the ETL magic!).
Storage: Stored and managed all the structured data in a robust PostgreSQL database.
The Finish Line: Brought the entire story to life using interactive dashboards in Power BI.
